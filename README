This is a demo Textbox application made with OpenGL (immediate mode) and GLUT. You type in the bottom box, and <return> will send the text to the top box. Supports wrapping and horizontal line displacement. 

TODO:
* Fix drawing on resize
* Move functionality to separate library
* Add scrollbars
* Enable select/deselect boxes

It was originally made as a proof-of-concept for a class, so the next step is to contain all of the Textbox functionality into a separate library.
